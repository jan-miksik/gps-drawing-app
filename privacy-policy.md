**This application uses privacy first approach**

## What We Do

- ✅ Process GPS data on your device to create drawings
- ✅ Store your drawings locally on your device
- ✅ Let you export drawings in different formats
- ✅ Work without internet connection

## What We DON'T Do

- ❌ Collect your location data on our servers
- ❌ Track your usage or behavior  
- ❌ Share data with third parties
- ❌ Use analytics or advertising
- ❌ Require personal information

## How Location Data Works

1. **GPS Collection**: Used in real-time to create your drawings
2. **Local Processing**: All calculations happen on your device
3. **Local Storage**: Drawings saved only on your device
4. **Your Control**: Delete drawings anytime or uninstall to remove everything

## Export Options (Your Choice)

When you choose to export a drawing, you have three options:

| Export Type | What It Contains | Privacy Level |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| **SVG Image** | Just the visual drawing | ✅ Safe to share |
| **Relative Coordinates** | Normalized position data | ⚠️ Medium privacy |
| **Real GPS Coordinates** | Actual latitude/longitude | ❌ Think before sharing |

**Important**: Only you decide if and when to export. The app never shares anything automatically.
